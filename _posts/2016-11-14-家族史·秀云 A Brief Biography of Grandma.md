奶奶的一生其实也很简单，不太平的时候都是在13岁前。

一九三八年，奶奶出生在北京城南黑窑厂街的一个大杂院的东厢房。院子里还住着几户，都和奶奶的家庭一样是穷苦人家。奶奶上边还有一个姐姐。两三岁时，奶奶的妈妈在生弟弟时难产而死，奶奶的爸爸将奶奶托付给住大杂院正房的一家没有孩子的夫妻，说要自己出去找活干。说是正房，其实也没什么分别，这家里的男人也不过就是在南城杀猪的屠户而已。奶奶的姐姐也被托付给另一户人家了，从此姐妹失去联系。
  
“我当时小，还埋怨，怎么不要我了……后来我大了也逐渐想明白了，带着个孩子怎么干活啊……”

奶奶就这样离开了她所有亲人。也许有寄人篱下的滋味吧，她没有讲。

虽有埋怨，奶奶还是一直等着她的爸爸回来接她，可是爸爸一直没出现过。过了几年，有一个不认识的人来要接走她，那家屠户说：“让他亲自来接。我不能随随便便让她跟你走。”
  
“没出现可能是因为愧疚吧，当初把我给别人养了.....也可能是看我在这儿过得也不错，觉得不来接更好吧……”

后来屠户一家带奶奶从黑窑厂搬到了西边一些的大川淀胡同，这两个地方在1948年的北京地图里也不过是很短很短的距离而已。奶奶上小学了，在北边江苏会馆的江苏小学，识得了几个字。上到五年级，正是建国后的第一年，新中国的土地政策让屠户动了回乡下的念头。

屠户与多灾多难的20世纪同岁，到半百时已经经历了太多，虽然北京城一时平静下来了，可也许自给自足的农民生活才是一生平安的保证吧。

“那会儿我才13岁……可能现在你们13岁知道很多了，我那时也不懂得，让我跟着去农村我也就去了，也没说什么…不过那时的北京也不像现在，也很破，只有天安门是大马路，别处也都是土路……”

他们去的村子在北京城正南50公里，属于河北省。初到农村的奶奶也是五谷不分，可是她也不吭声，默默地看默默地记住。

算一算奶奶该是18、9岁结的婚，爷爷与她同岁，谁大谁小倒是不知了，奶奶的生日是编的，没有妈妈也不知道具体日子。

20出头的时候，奶奶生了第一个儿子，几年之后，第二个孩子又是男孩儿。之后又连续生了两个孩子，一女一男。不知道奶奶这四次生产经历中，有没有哪次想到了她死去的妈妈。

这次看到了爷爷奶奶的户口本，爷爷奶奶文化程度都是文盲或半文盲。爷爷应该是大字不识一个的，奶奶念了5年书，直到现在也认识许多字，我看新闻时她也会看电视上的字，问我这国的总统怎么怎么了。

爷爷就是很勤勤恳恳的农民，祖祖辈辈，对这个身份的认同应该已经到了骨子里，与生俱来。思想死板，干活却是从不含糊不偷懒，别的不去想。奶奶读过书，脑子灵活，身体却不大好。只能埋头苦干的农活不适合她，可是时代没有给她选择的权利，命运就这么撞到她怀里，拽着她不撒手。

“生产队里每个人都必须完成那么多活儿，插秧时弯腰久了腰酸了，直直腰的功夫别人就超过你好多了。别人休息了，你还是要继续干完......我的腰就是那时候坏的。”

所以奶奶一直坚持让四个孩子都念书，只有念书才有机会走出农村，摆脱世代农民的身份。孩子们也都没辜负，大儿子在恢复高考的第一年就成为了全县第一个大学生。

1981年，81岁的老屠户与这个世界告别了。他前半生在北京城经历了能想到的一切动荡，清帝国灭亡，民国建立，日本人侵华，抗日完了又内战，建立新中国他也完全预料不到是否又是昙花一现。而后半生他也得到了自己想要的安宁，看着收养的女儿找到好人家，看到孙儿这么争气……这一生有得有失，也许在临去前终于回归到一个零了吧。而在孙儿眼中，他是做饭好吃的慈祥姥爷，在女儿眼中，他“待我真好，和亲爸一样。”

其他三个孩子似乎也都继承奶奶聪慧的头脑，成绩好，在城里谋得职位，甚至兜兜转转又成了北京市民。她终于放心了。

日子又过了好多年，她从母亲变成奶奶/姥姥，过年时一家子热热闹闹、其乐融融。这些都是她的血脉她的亲人，她再也不会像从前那样孤单了。

她说这是她的命，农民的身份绝不是她想要的。也许丈夫也不是，太老实，不多想事，所以几年前爷爷糊涂了，成了老小孩，而她一直头脑清醒，还要继续照顾他。每天念叨的嫌弃埋怨也可能又是一种发泄，因为她仍被旧社会的思想束缚，也仍被这个眷恋乡土的丈夫困在村里的一间小院儿。也许根本没有爱情没有心动，只是又一次无奈的选择。可她一生也该有许多幸福时刻吧，在她第一次发现老屠户待她如亲生女儿，她真真实实感受到亲情的那一刻；在当兵的儿子过了几年终于从海上回家看她她发现他高了壮了的那一刻；在她四个孩子都摆脱了农民身份，她被全村人羡慕的那一刻；还有每一次孙儿们回到她那间小院子团聚的时候；也许还有明年，她将抱上孙子的孩子，四世同堂的时候……

这一年，属于爷爷和奶奶的两亩地被征收。勤勤恳恳这一辈子，也只是为了不饿肚子。人近八十，却突然得了一笔财富，哪还有什么喜忧，能靠财富支持改变命运的年纪已经远去了……同村的人也基本都交了地换钱，是一笔财富，可对那些仍旧世代农民的人来说，这却是只顾眼前，根本不为下一代考虑的行为。前几年陆续有邻村土地被征收，爷爷还大骂：“没地了，以后吃什么！”可现在公开的谈，他也听不明白是什么事了，一言不发，怎不唏嘘。

而这对奶奶来说却是最合适不过，年老了也种不了地，孩子们彻底告别农村，孙儿们连一天农活也不曾干过，连地也没下过，农村只是他们儿时天然的游乐场而已。土地租给别人耕种一年也只收一千块而已，农民一年到头的收入也是微薄的。现在她连收租也免去了，就安安稳稳过老年生活就好。

她不再盼着与面目模糊的爸爸、姐姐的团聚，而是盼着每月每周她的后代来看她——这些能实现的期盼。

“姐姐到现在也没找着，也许不知道什么时候死在哪儿了吧……爸爸后来也再没找过我，也许也是兵荒马乱地死在哪了才没来找我吧……”

“有时候我也做梦，梦见一个老头，长得跟我挺像，也是圆脸儿，来看我……早几年做的梦了，现在也不做了……”

My grandma's whole life is simple, mostly undisturbed after the age of thirteen.

In 1938, Grandma was born in the eastern wing room of a large, communal courtyard on Heiyaochang (meaning "Black Kiln") Street in the southern part of Beijing. The courtyard housed several other impoverished families, similar to her own. Grandma had an older sister. When Grandma was around two or three years old, her mother died in childbirth while delivering her brother, leading her father to leave her and her sister in the care of a childless couple living in the main house of the same courtyard, saying he needed to find work. Their main house was not much better, and the man was simply a butcher in the southern part of the city. Grandma's sister was also left with another family, and from then on, the sisters lost contact.

“I was young then, and I resented being left behind... As I grew older, I understood that it was hard to find a work and take care of children at the same time.”

Since then, Grandma was separated from all her blood relatives. Maybe she had even felt the bitter taste of living under somebody else's thumb, but she didn't say. Despite her grievances, she always hoped her biological father would return for her, but he never did. After a few years, a stranger came to take her away on the behalf of her father, but the butcher insisted, “Let him come himself to fetch her. I can't just hand her over carelessly.”

“Probably he then gave me up because of guilt... Or perhaps he thought it was better not to disturb me since I was well off here...”

Later, the butcher's family moved with Grandma from Heiyaochang to Dachuandian Alley, a mere short distance on the 1948 map of Beijing. Grandma started elementary school at the Jiangsu School in the Jiangsu Guild Hall, learning a few characters. By the fifth grade, the first year of the newly founded People's Republic of China, the land reforms prompted the butcher to consider returning to his village.

The butcher, as old as the turbulent 20th century itself, had seen much by midlife. Though Beijing was momentarily calm, perhaps the self-sustaining life of a farmer was the only guarantee of peace.

“I was only thirteen then... Perhaps thirteen-year-old youth today knows much more, but I didn’t understand much at that time. When they decided to move to the countryside, I just followed. Beijing was dilapidated back then too, with only Tiananmen being a paved road. Everywhere else was just dirt tracks.”

Their destination was a village located 50 kilometers directly south of Beijing, in Hebei Province. Initially unable to distinguish between different grains, Grandma quietly observed and remembered without complaint.

Grandma must have been 18 or 19 when she married Grandpa, who was around her age, though exact ages were unclear since her birthday was fabricated and she had no mother to confirm the date.

In her early twenties, Grandma gave birth to her first son, followed by a second boy a few years later, and then two more children—a girl and a boy. It's unknown if during these four childbirths, she ever thought of her own deceased mother.

I saw Grandpa and Grandma's household registration recently; both were illiterate or semi-literate. Grandpa couldn't recognize a single character, while Grandma, having attended school for five years, still recognized many words and would watch the news on TV, asking me about the presidents of various countries.

Grandpa was a diligent farmer, deeply identified with his heritage, rigid in thought but meticulous in his work. Grandma, educated and quick-witted, struggled with the physical demands of farming, unsuitable for her frail health. The era allowed her no choices; fate had thrown its challenges at her, relentlessly holding on.

“In the production team, everyone had to complete so much work. Bending over for long periods during rice planting, my back would hurt; straightening up for a moment, others would far surpass you. Even if others rested, you had to continue... It was then that my back was ruined.”

So, Grandma insisted that all four children pursue education as the only way out of the village, to escape the perpetual identity of peasants. Her children did not disappoint; her eldest son became the first university student in the county during the first year college exams were reinstated.

In 1981, the old butcher, aged 81, passed away. His earlier life in Beijing had witnessed every conceivable upheaval—from the fall of the Qing dynasty, the establishment of the Republic, the Japanese invasion, and the civil wars, to the unexpected founding of the new China. His latter years achieved the peace he desired, watching his adopted daughter marry well and his grandchildren thrive. His life was a mixture of gains and losses, perhaps finally reconciled at its end. In his grandchildren's eyes, he was a kindly grandfather who cooked delicious meals; in his daughter's eyes, “He treated me very well, just like a real father.”

Grandma's other three children also inherited her clever mind, doing well in school, securing jobs in the city, eventually becoming residents of Beijing again. She could finally rest easy.

Years passed, and she transitioned from mother to grandma, enjoying lively, joyful family gatherings during holidays. These were her descendants, her kin; she would never feel as alone as she once did.

Grandma said this is her fate. The identity of a farmer was never what she wanted. Perhaps not even her husband was: Too honest, not a thinker. Thus, a few years ago when Grandpa became senile, turning into a child again, she had to continue caring for him. The daily nagging and complaints were perhaps another form of release, for she was still bound by old societal norms and by this husband who clung to his native soil. Maybe there was never love, just another helpless choice. But there must have been many happy moments in her life — like the first time she truly felt kinship when the old butcher treated her as his real daughter; when her son, who had been in the navy, returned home after several years, becoming taller and stronger; when all her children escaped the identity of peasants, earning the village's envy; and every time her grandchildren gathered in her small courtyard, perhaps even next year, when she would hold a great-grandson, experiencing four generations under one roof…”

This year, the two acres of land belonging to Grandpa and Grandma were expropriated. A lifetime of diligent work was just to stave off hunger. Approaching eighty, they suddenly received a sum of money—what joy or sorrow could it bring at their age? Their fellow villagers also traded their land for money, a wealth that, while immediate, disregarded future generations. In previous years, when neighboring villages had their land expropriated, Grandpa had cursed, “Without land, what will we eat!” Now, he no longer understood these discussions, remaining silent, how poignant.

For Grandma, this was more than appropriate; too old to farm, her children and grandchildren had completely left rural life, the countryside merely a natural playground of their childhood. Leasing the land for farming barely brought in a thousand yuan a year—a meager income. Now she could forego even collecting rent, simply living out her old age in peace.

She no longer hoped for a reunion with her dimly remembered father or sister, but looked forward to the regular visits from her descendants—these achievable expectations.

“Maybe my sister died somewhere unknown... My father never came looking for me after that, perhaps died in the chaos of war...”

“Sometimes I dreamt of an old man, round-faced just like me, coming to see me... It's been years since I last had that dream...”
