<p>In China, thereâ€™s a common perception among nationalistic netizens that South Koreans often claim elements of Chinese culture as their own, like certain traditional festivals, which has fostered a somewhat negative impression of South Korea in some circles. However, after watching the impactful movies based on real Korean historical events, like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6878038/"><em>A Taxi Driver</em></a>, Iâ€™ve come to see how South Korea has confronted its turbulent history, particularly democratic uprisings. This also left a strong impression on me that South Korea is much more progressive in terms of political democracy than China, for those movements took place nearly two decades before the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident in China, and today (7 years ago) South Korean openly remember and reflect on those times in popular movies, whereas in China, despite over three decades, it remains a taboo topic in China, absent from media and classrooms. As a result, young generations are unaware of this pivotal moment in our recent history. This silence hampers our democratic education on civil rights and societal progress. We lost something in spirit and our society increasingly focuses on individual interests like wealth and material success.</p>

<p>Beyond the Oscar-winning movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/"><em>Parasite</em></a>, Iâ€™ve come to admire how South Korean acknowledge and reflect on their past through these historical movies. As a Chinese, I can only rely on these Korean movies (even though they are often banned in China) to imagine how similar events have unfolded in my countryâ€™s history, how sad! I hope that one day, in my lifetime, Iâ€™ll see a Chinese movie like <em>A Taxi Driver</em> on cinema screens!</p>
