I"a<p>This summer I had an impressive 2-day-hike in the valley from Calfeisental to Weisstannental in Switzerland with friends. Before I hadn’t had any long-term hiking experience, I set off with anxiety and excite. From Zurich main station, we took the train to Gigerwald Staudamm. After a relaxing ramble under the impressive walls of the highest St. Gallen mountains, we reached the end of the lake and headed for the valley.</p>

<p>After 7-hour exhausting trekking from the bottom of the mountain over the lake and the hamlet of St. Martin, we finally arrived at the Sardona Hut, where accommodated us. It was the first time I slept over at a mountain cottage, and I didn’t expect that in the valley, there was no access to the internet, and my phone also warned me that here had no service. I decided to take a stroll to kill time. I went across a bridge over the creek, then I saw the clear blue sky mirroring the river’s sparkling effects, which the yellow and red leaves under the water. That was an impeccable scene.</p>

<p>When it started drizzling, I turned back and chatted with friends in front of the cottage. I greedily breathed the fresh air and comforted myself with the charming pastoral view. After a few hours of chilling, the sky gradually became gloomy. Thanks to the lack of electricity, we went to bed early and had adequate rest for the next day’s journey.</p>

<p>Early next morning, we continued our hike on the Sardona World Heritage trail. Passing through Älplichopf, Gspaltengrat, with a view of the Ringelspitz we reached the Heidelpass. There the descent to Weisstannen begins. We have passed several waterfalls, which are the landmark of the Weisstannental.</p>

<p>Our hike ended at Weisstannen Oberdorf, from which we took the train back to Zürich. Though the journey was not easy, it was worthwhile since it granted me an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city life.</p>
