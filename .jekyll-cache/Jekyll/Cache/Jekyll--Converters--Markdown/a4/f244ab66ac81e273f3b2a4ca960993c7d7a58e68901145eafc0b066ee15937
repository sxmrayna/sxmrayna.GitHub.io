<p>夜里十一点半的天桥地铁站聚众吃包子😂<br />
有笑有泪，近四个小时也不显冗长，《宝岛一村》经典版确实足够经典，因为是真实的群体记忆而格外感人。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“有一天吃完早饭，我看着你的背影，二十啷当意气风发的年轻小伙子，你就出门了；<br />
现在，到了晚饭时间，门一推开，进来一个老头……”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“台生，人生的遭遇哪是人能够估算的？”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“人活着就是要开心，尽量地开心，一群人要开心，一个人也要开心。”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>其中一个令我印象很深的情节是当四十余年后的老朱、小朱和朱妈回到大陆的时候，老朱在进门前跟妻子说：“里面的人大你一点，你要管她叫姐姐。”<br />
妻子说：“哦，她是你的姐姐。”<br />
然后老朱就很尴尬地在解释，但是也含糊不清。</p>

<p>其实这时候观众已经可以猜到，里面的人应该是老朱在大陆时的妻子。时隔这么多年后，即便人们都身不由己，站在台湾妻子的角度，可能也会有那么一丝埋怨或者是吃味丈夫的不专一。<br />
但横跨了四十余年灾难性的人生遭遇，切身体验了命运的难以掌握之后，其实也很能理解老朱的选择和命运的辗转多舛。<br />
所以即便是在妻子的角度，也会能够理解剧里她把丈夫在大陆的妻子也真正视为自己的亲人，对方也让自己的儿子管她叫二娘。<br />
可能在这样漫长的岁月后，这段婚姻里的男女之间的爱情，相比于家庭、亲人、时代这些情感还是会小一些，会真正认为亲人的团聚更为重要。<br />
虽然这一段在剧里用了一种比较戏谑的方式去展现，但其实也是一个泪点。</p>

<p>第二个印象很深的是周伯伯，其实可以猜想到他是一位同性恋。当他说他去看望一位老朋友之墓的时候，也已经可以猜到那位——也是他的战友，也是他的朋友，应该也是他的爱人——在空难里英年早逝。<br />
他在他坟墓前说的那一段话还是非常非常令人感动的，即便能猜到这里面的一些故意设置的所谓套路，也还是会被他那段话所打动：</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>自你出事之后，我不再飞了。因为我就像和你一同死了。  <br />
但我为什么还活着？因为你跟我说，人生最重要的是要快乐，一个人也要快乐。</p>
</blockquote>

<p>我觉得这也是一种跨越了性别的爱，很感人。</p>

<p>在九十年代，当剧里的人们过了四十多年后重新回到故土的时候，是整部剧中我最被感动的那些情节。<br />
当然还有最终没有能回到故土的那些人，比如周妈妈一直想要回天津，一直在念叨说什么时候能回去，本来说过了年就能回，转眼之间她便去世了。<br />
还有顶替了自己的朋友在眷村生活的老赵，最后也很可怜，并没有回到自己的故乡。</p>

<p>至于下一代，相比第一代还是缺少与大陆的亲情羁绊，眷村与台湾就是他们从小生长的环境，剧情重点也是他们在这样的环境下的成长故事。他们没有第一代那样真正撕心裂肺的与亲人骨肉相离的感情，因为没有经历过是很难感同身受的。</p>

<p>疫情岁月里最大的担心也是像浅浅海峡一样一别就是半生。</p>

<p>In the tear-streaked moment, there was no longer any need for such harshness, for it was the true collective memory that touched us deeply.</p>

<p>With both laughter and tears, the near four-hour duration of “The Village: Classic Edition” never felt tedious. Indeed, it earns its designation as a classic because it resonates so deeply with the real memories of a community.</p>

<p>“One day, after breakfast, I watched your retreating figure—a vibrant young man in your twenties, full of vigor, stepping out the door. Now, come dinnertime, I open the door to find an old man entering…”</p>

<p>“Taiwanese, who can predict the encounters life throws at us?”</p>

<p>“To live is to be happy, as happy as possible, whether alone or together with others.”</p>

<p>A particularly poignant scene that left a deep impression on me occurs when, after over forty years, Old Zhu, Young Zhu, and Mother Zhu return to the mainland. Before entering the house, Old Zhu tells his wife, “The person inside is a bit older than you, you should call her sister.”
His wife responds, “Oh, she is your sister.”
Then, Old Zhu awkwardly tries to explain, but his words are muddled.</p>

<p>By this point, the audience can already guess that the woman inside is likely Old Zhu’s wife from his time on the mainland. Even after so many years, one might expect his Taiwanese wife to harbor a hint of resentment or jealousy over his infidelity. Yet, after experiencing the capriciousness of fate and the catastrophic events of over four decades, one can also deeply understand Old Zhu’s choices and the tumultuous twists of fate. Therefore, even from his wife’s perspective, she comes to truly see her husband’s wife from the mainland as her own kin, and even allows her son to call this woman “second mother.”</p>

<p>Perhaps, after such a long span of years, the romantic love between a man and a woman within this marriage pales in comparison to the bonds of family, kin, and era; they come to value the reunion of kin above all else. Although this part of the play is portrayed in a somewhat humorous manner, it remains a moment of profound emotional impact.</p>

<p>Another memorable character is Uncle Zhou, who one might surmise to be homosexual. When he talks about visiting the grave of an old friend—who was also his comrade, his friend, and likely his lover, who tragically died young in a plane crash—the audience might anticipate some intentional dramatic setups, yet his words at the grave are deeply moving:
“After your accident, I never flew again. It was as if I had died with you.
But why am I still alive? Because you told me that the most important thing in life is to be happy, even alone.”</p>

<p>I find this to be a moving expression of love transcending gender.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the scenes of the characters returning to their homeland after more than forty years were among the most emotionally stirring in the entire play. There are also those who never made it back, like Mother Zhou who always talked about returning to Tianjin, saying she would go back after the New Year, only to pass away before she could make the journey. And then there’s Old Zhao, who lived in a military dependents’ village after taking his friend’s place, ultimately meeting a similarly pitiful fate without ever returning to his native home.</p>

<p>As for the next generation, compared to their predecessors, they lack the deep familial ties with the mainland. The military dependents’ villages and Taiwan are the environments they grew up in, and the drama primarily explores their stories of growing up in these settings. They do not experience the heart-wrenching separation from kin that their elders did, making it difficult for them to truly empathize.</p>

<p>In the age of the pandemic, our greatest fear is that, like a shallow strait, a separation could last a lifetime.</p>
